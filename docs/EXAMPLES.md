## Writing Task 2 Examples

### Example 1: Opinion Essay

**Prompt Generated by the Tool:**
```
Some people believe that children should be allowed to stay at home and play 
until they are six or seven years old. Others believe that it is important 
for young children to go to school as soon as possible.

What do you think are the advantages of attending school from a young age?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your 
own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
```

**Sample Student Response:**
```
Early childhood education has become a topic of significant debate in recent 
years. While some parents prefer to keep their young children at home, I 
believe that attending school from an early age offers numerous advantages 
that benefit children's development.

First and foremost, early schooling provides children with essential social 
skills that are difficult to develop at home. When children interact with 
their peers in a structured environment, they learn to share, cooperate, and 
resolve conflicts. These social competencies are crucial for their future 
relationships and professional success. For instance, my younger brother, who 
started nursery at age three, developed confidence and communication skills 
much faster than his cousin who stayed home until age six.

Furthermore, early education introduces children to structured learning 
routines that prepare them for formal academic instruction. Young minds are 
particularly receptive to learning languages, numbers, and basic concepts. 
Research has shown that children who attend preschool demonstrate better 
academic performance in later years compared to those who begin formal 
education at age six or seven.

Additionally, early schooling can identify learning difficulties or 
developmental delays sooner, allowing for timely intervention. Professional 
educators are trained to recognize signs that parents might miss, ensuring 
that children receive appropriate support when needed.

In conclusion, while home environment provides love and security, early 
schooling offers structured learning, social development, and professional 
guidance that significantly benefit young children's overall growth and 
future academic success.

### Example 2: Discussion Essay

**Prompt:**
```
Some people think that governments should spend more money on public 
transportation. Others believe that private vehicle ownership should be 
encouraged instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Write at least 250 words.
```

**Sample Response (Lower Band):**
```
Transportation is very important topic nowadays. Some people think government 
should spend money on public transport and others think private cars are better.

Public transportation have many good points. It is cheaper for people to use 
bus and train instead of buying car. Also it is better for environment because 
less pollution when many people use same vehicle. In my country, many people 
use public transport and it works good.

But private cars also have advantages. People can go anywhere they want and 
anytime. They dont need to wait for bus or train. Also more comfortable because 
you have your own space. Rich people usually prefer private cars because they 
can afford.

However, I think both are important. Government should improve public transport 
so more people will use it. But people should also have choice to buy private 
car if they want. In big cities, public transport is very necessary because 
too many cars make traffic jam.

In conclusion, both public and private transport are needed. Government should 
make good public transport system but also allow people to have private cars.
