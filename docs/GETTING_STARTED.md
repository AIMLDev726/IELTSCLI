### Step 3: Get an AI API Key

You need an API key from one of these providers:

2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" in the left menu
4. Click "Create new secret key"

#### Option B: Google AI (Alternative)
1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API Key"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key

#### Option C: Local Setup (No API Key Needed)
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
2. Run: `ollama pull llama2`
3. This runs everything locally on your computer

## Initial Setup

### First Run

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will ask you to configure it. Here's what to do:

1. **Choose your AI provider**:
   - Type `1` for OpenAI (best results)
   - Type `2` for Google AI  
   - Type `3` for Ollama (local)

2. **Enter your API key** (skip for Ollama):
   - Paste the API key you copied earlier
   - The application will test the connection

3. **Set preferences**:
   - Choose your default task type (recommend: Writing Task 2)
   - Enable detailed feedback (recommended: Yes)

## Your First Practice Session

### Starting Practice
